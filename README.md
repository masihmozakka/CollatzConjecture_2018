# CollatzConjecture_2018

\\
This code was written during my studies on the Collatz Conjecture, it contains many functions to calculate different iterations. It makes extensive use of matplotlib and some use of numpy particularly regarding matrices. im sure this code is most likely broken as i have re written it so many times. it took me around a week to master matplotlib and 2 days to write this code. its sole purpose was to help me visualize the research i was conducting when focusing on the titular subject.
